# ECE-4414-Project
Guidelines ● Select a song from 4 chord song website ● The team performs the selected song (the location to be determined). ● All musical instruments have to be implemented using “wearables” thus “air instruments.” ● Audio output from each band member will be fed to a mixer using RCA jack. ● Audio amp, speakers, mixer, and audio cables will be provided to the “band.” ● You are allowed to use any sensor for chord implementation. ● Each band is encouraged to have a “performance” look. (ex: matching T-shirts (provided), matching the original band look etc.) Include your group number and band name. One submission per team. In the proposal you are to describe your approach and strategy. Do not write an essay, one paragraph of text supported by diagrams and charts is more useful. Please be neat and concise. You are welcome to use state machines, flow charts, tables, etc. You are required to include bill of materials (BOM) in the proposal.
